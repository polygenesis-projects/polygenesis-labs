## How to contribute to the PolyGenesis Labs

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* Make sure the bug was not already reported here: [Issues](https://github.com/polygenesis-io/polygenesis-labs/issues).

* If nonexisting, open a new issue for the problem: [Open New Issue](https://github.com/polygenesis-io/polygenesis-labs/issues'new). Always provide a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Patches and bug fixes**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* It would be really nice if your followed the basic code format used prevalently.

#### **Please don't reformat existing code**

* Just because you don't like a given code style doesn't mean you have the authority to change it. Cosmetic changes add zero to little value.

#### **New features and enhancements**

* Email your post your suggestion and provide an example implementation.

* After agreement open a PR or issue.

#### **Direct questions to...**
